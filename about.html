<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Well if i talk about me, right now , i am a engineering student at Dj sanghvi college, i have an iq of 135 ,
   which is quite high from what i have heard, yet i dont feel very smart , probably because i had a very smart bestfriend,
   named Gurshaan Nandrajog, till now he is one of the smartest guy i have met along with Nathan, weridly hard working fella .
</p>

<p>Here i am not really typing as i should in a portfolio cause i am kinda bored and dont exactly know how to 
  do that. Well i think i have and incrediblw talent to learn things fast. But am incredibly bad at social skills somehow,
  like i can observe and understand what and why others do stuff but am not able to recreate with same efficiency , maybe cause 
  i havent repeated enough time.
</p>

<p>Today i learnt about what use of eq is, I as a human i feel i have incredible EQ, yet i dont use it,
  in everday college life. Why ? cause i am stupid ugg. Now that it has come to my attention , i sure as damm will,
  EQ and active hearning and observations are the next skills i want to master
